# Exercise 0: Github and Environment Setting

First, clone this repository to your local machine. All WebGL program files are under the folder `html/`. Locate the file we need to use for this exercise `html/hello_world.html`.

You should be able to open the file with any browser. You will see a red triangle in the middle of a black canvas is everything works correctly. No special environment is needed to make this work.

Now, open the project folder with any editor you like. Find the file `html/hello_world.html`. You will see the code used to draw the red triangle. You do not need to understand everything in this step. I will get to the details of this code in next exercise. **For this exercise, screenshot the rendered triangle and submit to BlackBoard**. This is just to make sure your environment is working.
